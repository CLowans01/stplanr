# Distance interpolation  to generate mean distance travelled map --------------------------------------------------

# Each SOA centroid will have a mean distance to be travelled from it (as an origin). Interpolate this across a raster dataset?

# interpolate the st dev as a map

# load the distance matrix from the cluster analysis script
